       "\n",
       "Here's the key to solving it:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Visualize the Books on the Shelf:**\n",
       "    *   Volume 1 is on the left.\n",
       "    *   Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
       "    *   When books are placed on a shelf in standard English-reading order (spines facing outwards), the physical arrangement of their components is:\n",
       "\n",
       "        **Volume 1 (left):**\n",
       "        [Back Cover] -- [Pages] -- [Front Cover]\n",
       "\n",
       "        **Volume 2 (right):**\n",
       "        [Back Cover] -- [Pages] -- [Front Cover]\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   So, the sequence of materials a worm gnawing from left to right would encounter is:\n",
       "        **[Back Cover V1] -- [Pages V1] -- [Front Cover V1] || [Back Cover V2] -- [Pages V2] -- [Front Cover V2]**\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Define \"First Page\" and \"Last Page\":**\n",
       "    *   The \"first page\" of a volume is the very first leaf of paper you read, which is *just inside* the front cover.\n",
       "    *   The \"last page\" of a volume is the very last leaf of paper you read, which is *just inside* the back cover.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Trace the Worm's Path:**\n",
       "    *   The worm starts \"from the first page of the first volume.\" Looking at our shelf arrangement, the \"first page\" of Volume 1 is located next to its *Front Cover* (the rightmost part of Volume 1).\n",
       "    *   The worm gnaws \"to the last page of the second volume.\" The \"last page\" of Volume 2 is located next to its *Back Cover* (the leftmost part of Volume 2).\n",
       "\n",
       "    Therefore, the worm's journey is from the *right side* of Volume 1 (specifically, from its \"first page\" inside its front cover) to the *left side* of Volume 2 (specifically, to its \"last page\" inside its back cover).\n",
       "\n",
       "    The worm will gnaw through:\n",
       "    *   It **starts at** the first page of Volume 1, so it gnaws *past* all of Volume 1's pages.\n",
       "    *   It gnaws through the **Front Cover of Volume 1** (2 mm).\n",
       "    *   It gnaws through the **Back Cover of Volume 2** (2 mm).\n",
       "    *   It **stops at** the last page of Volume 2, so it has *not* gnawed through any of Volume 2's pages.\n",
       "\n",
       "    The pages of both volumes are entirely bypassed by the worm because of the books' orientation on the shelf and the definition of start/end points.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n",
       "    *   Thickness of the front cover of Volume 1 = 2 mm\n",
       "    *   Thickness of the back cover of Volume 2 = 2 mm\n",
       "\n",
       "    Total distance = 2 mm + 2 mm = 4 mm\n",
